Explorant des pistes de développement autour de la publication en open edition de contenus scientifiques multimédia à destination d'un public large, le choix s'est porté sur l'Atlas de la mondialisation, dont la dernière édition datait de 2013. D'autres acteurs de Sciences Po ont accompagné ce projet, parmi lesquels la Direction des Études et de la Scolarité (DES) et les Presses de Sciences Po.  La société ByteClub a réalisé les développements.",
