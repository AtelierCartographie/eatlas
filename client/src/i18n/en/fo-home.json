    "Looking at the world as a mobile and fluid space, emancipating itself from the idea of an international scene orchestrated by the States alone and the notions of enemy, border and exclusive identities. Study how globalization processes shape public policy and social behavior. Show how all actors - public or private, individual or collective, political, economic and social, local, national, regional or global - interact, exchange, cooperate or clash. To represent the interdependencies and entanglements of our stories, as well as the disorders and dysfunctions of a complex and unequal world. This is the ambition of this atlas which tackles these issues in a transdisciplinary way by crossing the approaches of geographers and political scientists specializing in international relations.",
